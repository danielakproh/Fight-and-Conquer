## Purpose

This guide is meant to be a mix between formal and explanatory documentation. 

## Synopsis

an RPG combat & strategy game made with the Unity Engine.

## Introduction

Fight & Conquer is an RPG game-type project in which Franck (the main character) has to rescue his loved one who has been kidnapped and emprisonned in a tower while he was away. Coming back home after a long, tiring but productive day of work, he realizes the absence of his significant other. Sad & upset, he decides to go find & bring her despites all the hard-to-beat enemies that will be on his way.

## Scope & Game Design

The general idea behing this game is to do experiment with as much new programming techniques as possible and to put my knowledge of game achitecture into practice. The game art will be improved later down th line, but the main primary focus is the programming aspect of it.
The requirements for this game are as follows:

* The terrain for this game should be procedurally created
* The use should be able to control the player character with their mouse wherever the cursor points at (clicking for using weapon)
* The enemies should be AI-controlled
* The game should include an inventory system to manage weapons and other in-game resources
* The game should have a saving system to allow users to save their progress (how far they got in the world, how many enemies they killed etc.)
* The game should have a dialogue quest to allow the player character to interact with other in-game characters
* The game should have a Weapon management system to keep track of the defense resources
* The game will have an In-game store for allowing the player to buy assets with in-game currency
